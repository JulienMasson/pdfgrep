*pdfgrep* is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU/Emacs]] module providing ~grep~ comparable facilities

The ~pdfgrep~ program must be installed on your system.

If the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] module is installed and enabled, when a matching page
is displayed, the matching regions are highlighted.
